# oak-docker-node

This contains a base docker image for node projects.

It uses [passenger-docker](https://github.com/phusion/passenger-docker) to set up a good default environment for Ruby, Python, Node.js and Meteor apps. This is built on top of [baseimage-docker](http://phusion.github.io/baseimage-docker/) which sets up good defaults for containerized Ubuntu.
